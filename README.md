# ðŸš— Garage project

The **Garage project** is a console based application that allows you to create and manage multiple garages. **When a garage is created, its capacity is set upon creation and cannot be changed later.** You can add, remove, and display vehicles within each garage based on its initial capacity.

Each garage can store a variety of vehicles, such as cars, motorcycles, boats, buses, and airplanes, each with unique properties. The project also supports saving and loading garage data from a file, making it easy to manage your garage setup across different sessions.
